# Elementary data reliability
Elementary is an open-source data reliability solution for modern data teams.
Our goal is to provide data teams **immediate visibility, detection of data issues, and impact analysis**.
We focus on **simple effortless setup**, and integrations with the existing stack. 

**This package is designed for tables data monitoring and dbt monitoring.**
The package is Elementary integration with your dbt project, read more here [documentation](https://docs.elementary-data.com/).
Using an 'on-run-end' macro, it uploads your monitoring configuration and dbt artifacts.

To learn more on how to monitor your DWH, refer to our [main repo](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary-lineage).
