# Elementary data reliability
Elementary is an open-source data reliability solution for modern data teams.
Our goal is to provide data teams **immediate visibility, detection of data issues, and impact analysis**.
We focus on **simple effortless setup**, and integrations with the existing stack. 

**This package is designed for continuous monitoring of your data and dbt operation. 
It includes monitoring of quality metrics, freshness, volume and schema changes, including anomaly detection, configured and executed as dbt tests.**

The package is [Elementary](https://www.elementary-data.com/) integration with your dbt project, read more here [documentation](https://docs.elementary-data.com/).
To learn more on how to monitor your DWH, refer to our [main repo](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary-lineage). 

## Data anomalies monitoring as dbt tests

Elementary delivers **data monitoring and anomaly detection as dbt tests.** 
  
Elementary dbt tests are data monitors that collect metrics and metadata over time. 
On each execution, the tests analyze the new data, compare it to historical metrics, and alert on anomalies and outliers. 
  
**Elementary data monitors as tests are configured and executed like native tests in your project!**
