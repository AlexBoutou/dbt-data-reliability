# Elementary data reliability
Elementary is an open-source data reliability solution for modern data teams.\
Our goal is to provide data teams **immediate visibility, detection of data issues, and impact analysis**.\
We focus on **simple effortless setup**, and integrations with the existing stack. 

**This package is designed for source tables monitoring.**\
Elementary leverages your source defintions in your dbt project, so no extra configuration is needed (and if you don't have sources definied yet, see our [documnetation](https://docs.elementary-data.com/) on how to create a minimal version of it).

Detections:
- Columns and tables that were removed.
- Data type changes.
- New columns and tables.
- Coming soon - jsons schema validation.

To learn more on how to monitor your sources, including configuration and Slack alerts, refer to our [main repo](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary-lineage). 

## Getting started
Check out the [full documentation](https://docs.elementary-data.com/). \
Start by [using our CLI](https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary-lineage) to auto-generate the configuration and Slack alerts.

## Data warehouse support
This package has been tested on Snowflake.\
Additional integrations coming soon!\
